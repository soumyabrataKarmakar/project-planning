    Arambagh Seeds Farm (brand: Mahan) is an agriculture/seeds business operating
    primarily offline. They need a branding website with a product catalog (no public

    custom prices. Admin needs to manage categories, products, dealers, and per-dealer
    pricing. Contact form needed. Design may be additional cost.
